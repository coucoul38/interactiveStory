      <p>
        You choose to use your red gem to fuel the Key of Doom.<br>
        You put it in the emplacement of the same shape, and it starts to cast a powerfull red light.<br>
        You lift the key and a transparent door lock appears in front of you.<br>
        You put the key in, and turn it.<br>
        This closes all portals between Hell and the Overworld, but you immediatly feel a pain in your chest as you run out of breath.<br>
        By closing the portals, you broke the magical link between you and your homerealm, condemning you to a painfull death.<br>
        You will be remembered as the hero who offered his life to save the demon realm from the humans.
