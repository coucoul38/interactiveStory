      <h2>>Surrender and tell them you're here to help</h2>
      <p>
        You raise your hands and tell them you're not here to fight, but to help them.
        You explain that there's a human camp on the other side of the portal, and that crusaders will kill all of them if they find the town.<br>
        They seem skeptical, and guards come your way and search you.<br>
        One of them finds the red gem you took previously, and frantically asks you were you found it.<br>
        You tell them you just found it in a chest, and they explain you it is a magical stone used to fuel artifacts.<br>
        You've heard of those before, powerful magical objects that could turn the tide of the war forever.<br>
        They tell you are the chosen one, and that only you only should decide what to do with the stone.
        They then say they'll escort you to the artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You follow the guards, going deeper and deeper inside the city's walls, finally stopping in front of what seems to be an old cathedral.<br>
        The doors open, and you are blown away by how big this structure actually is.<br>
        Giant arches support a ceiling so high a dragon could fit inside.
        You never though demons could build such piece of architectural art.<br>
        A few steps later, a demon girl dressed as a nun come your way and asks the guards why they're bringing you here.<br>
        The guards explain everything, and she promptly agrees to show you the artifacts.<br>
        As you follow her down the cathedral's undergrounds, she come closer to explain you what those artifacts are.
        She tells you that they are keeping two of them : the Mirror of Apocalypse and the Key of Doom, but those are so ancient that everyone forgot what their use is.<br>
        You finally enter a large cavern, with the two magical items waiting for you on stone pedestals.<br>
        The artifacts look as described by the nun, one beeing a golden handheld mirror and the other a comically large tin key.<br>
        The nun tells you the magical gem you posess can only be bind to one of them, and so you have to make a choice.
