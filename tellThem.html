      <p>
        You decide to report everything to this priest, from the sound you heard while patrolling, to what you saw on the other side of the portal.<br>
        The Priest thanks you for your loyalty and tells you he will handle it.<br>
        He insists that you are probably tired after this night patrol and tell you multiple times to go back in your tent and sleep.<br>
        He then leaves you alone in a hurry.<br>
