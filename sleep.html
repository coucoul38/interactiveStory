      <h2>>Go to sleep</h2>
      <p>
        You go to your tent and sleep after a hard day of work.<br>
        <img src="images/amimir.png" alt="a mimir">
        When you wake up the next morning, you learn that a battalion was sent into the portal and found a demon city.<br>
        You are then tasked to help setting up the camp on the other side.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        You go through the portal and enter the empty city.<br>
        There is blood on the streets, evidence that a battle took place here.<br>
        When you ask why to another soldier, he tells not to worry, for that they cleansed the city of demons.<br>
        You don't feel like moving boxes around, and so you decide to go for a walk in the city.
        From where you are, two buildings stand out : a cathedral, deeper in the city, and what seems like the city hall.
