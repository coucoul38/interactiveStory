      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hundreds of years ago, demons opened portals between our world and Hell. They came through and pillaged our towns, wrecking havoc in our peacefull kingdom.<br>
        But after the first era of pannic, the Church of Osesis pressed the king to raise an army to fight against those horrible creatures.
        Every able man was enlisted, and soon the demons were pushed back to their realm. But this was not the end.<br>
        The Church recruited the best fighters it could find, to create an army of elite soldiers wich goal was to put an end to the demonic menace once and for all.<br>
        They were called the crusaders, and their mission, was to fight demons down in Hell.

        At least that what they say in books, you think to yourself. <br>

        As you get ready for patrol, you look up to the stars.
        The moon casts a dim light in the silent sky, and all you can hear is the distant mumbling of your superiors in their tents periodically interrupted by the uncanny crackling of the portal.<br>
        This gate to Hell was discovered a few weeks ago, and your batalion was sent to keep it safe.<br>
        You start patrolling, and as you walk close by, you hear a strange noise comming from the other side of the portal.<br>
