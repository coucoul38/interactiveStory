      <h2>>Go to the city hall</h2>
      <p>
        You walk up to the city hall.<br>
        You enter and search in every room hoping to find usefull intel.<br>
        Its strange how well organised this administration seems, almost as good as what we have in our kingdom.<br>
        Anyway, you keep searching and come to what might be the mayor office. There is a single letter on the desk.<br>
        You read it : It is from the Demon King, adressed to all mayors of his kingdom. He says he will offer shelter from humans to every civilians that are no longer safe in their towns.<br>
        The letter ends with instructions on how to find the King's castle and get through the magical barrier hiding it from unwanted eyes.
