      <p>
        You choose to use the blue gem to fuel the key.<br>
        You put it in the emplacement of the same shape, and it starts to cast a powerfull blue light.
        You lift the key and a transparent door lock appears in front of you.<br>
        You put the key in, and turn it.<br>
        This opens more portals between Hell and the Overworld at strategic locations, greatly facilitating the logistics of the human army.<br>
        The crusaders rapidly strike everywhere in Hell, and the war is soon finished thanks to you.
