      <h2>>Use the stone on the mirror</h2>
      <p>
        You pick up the mirror and put the blue stone in its handle.<br>
        Following this, the stone starts to glow very bright and your reflexion in the mirror gives place to visions of humans massacring demons.<br>
        Outraged by what this malefic item tries to make you believe, you throw it at the ground, breaking it.
        This frees a powerful demon trapped inside, which freezes you to death in its rage.<br>
        You broke the artifact by fear of it being malefic, but it was only showing you the truth.
