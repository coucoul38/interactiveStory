      <p>
        You are struck by what you just read, and decide you must take action to protect civilians, shall they be demons or not.<br>
        The plan is quite simple : if the General dies, he can't start attack. Oh, and the priest too.<br>
        You walk up to their tents, take out your sword and kill them in their sleep.<br>
        But as you get out, a passing by soldier sees the bodies and immediatly arrests you.<br>
