      <p>
        You go back to your tent to grab some equipment, when in the corner of your eye you notice a strange glow.<br>
        A red light is comming from under a cloth.
        You come closer and raise the piece of fabric, revealing a small chest.<br>
        You open it, and take a look inside : its only content is a red gem.<br>
        It emmits a bloody mesmerizing glow, and is engraved with runes.<br>
        This stone looks like a magical artifact, might be usefull where you're going.<br>
        You put it in your pocket and go back to the portal, checking your stuff again, and once you're sure to be ready, you take a deep breath, and step forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confusion, fear, pain even.<br>
        It seems that walking into another dimension isn't just as easy as taking a step forward.<br>
        But its okay, you made it through intact.
        You check for your belongings, they're all here, good.<br>
        The terrain looks as described in books: red stone and sand everywhere, in place of the sky you see a ceiling of the same stone covering the whole place.<br>
        You turn around and realise there's a whole town behind you.<br>
        As you walk through the front gate, you find yourself in the middle of a small market.<br>
        And then you realize : there is dozens, if not a hundreds of demons walking the streets.<br>
        If it was not for the omnipresent red color everywhere, it would look just like any human town.
        Even the demons don't look so monstrous, the only difference between you and them is their skin color, red as everything else. You also notice some of them have horns or tails.<br>
        As you were looking at this everyday life scene, a child notice you and screams "Human!".<br>
        In a few seconds, everyone flees away from you, and you see guards coming your way.
